/**
 * brief TS4231 localization implementation.
 * This code implements the use of one TS4231 and one HTC lighthouse v1 for localization.
 * The lighthouse needs to be set up in a room, and the corresponding photodiode
 * BPW34S of the TS4231 needs to be able to "see" the lighthouse, with no shaded objects between them.
 *
 * For the Dec.3 2023 version, we only distinguish whether the light from the lighthouse
 * is in the X-axis or the Y-axis. Simply put, there are 8 different lengths of sync light,
 * and we only classify them into two categories according to the axis information.

//=========================== interrupt handlers ==============================

/**
 * The falling edge interrupt is the start of a signal and we start the clock with t_0_start,
 * being the start moment of the signal. We also set flag_start to 1. This is because
 * we want the falling edge to be the start of the function's logic, and we will
 * check flag_start in the rising edge interrupt to make sure that the falling edge
 * interrupt is executed first before calculating the process that follows. In the rising
 * edge interrupt, we store the current moment in t_0_end and set flag_start to 0 to indicate
 * that we have completed the acquisition of this signal. We also put the value of this moment
 * into t_1_start at the end, which will be used for the subsequent calculation of the interval
 * between the two signals.
 *
 * The difference between the two moments is the duration of the signal, t_opt_pulse, which we
 * convert to us by dividing it by the number of ticks, and classify it into sync, sweep,
 * and skip_sync according to the duration (defined in ppi_gpiote.h as type_sync, type_sweep,
 * and type_skip_sync, respectively).
 *
 * Since the sync light of the two base stations alternates, i.e., when base station A transmits
 * 60-100us of light, base station B will follow with 100-150us of light. We choose to start the
 * logic from sweep light, which is convenient for us to distinguish the sequence of the two base
 * stations. In the rising edge interrupt, if we confirm that this light is a sweep, we set
 * flag_station to 1, so that when the next light comes, it must come from base station A. When
 * the next light is a skip_sync, we choose to give flag_station +1, so that the sync light after
 * the skip_sync knows that it is from base station B. In the sync light interrupt, we choose to
 * give flag_station +1, so that the sync light after the skip_sync knows that it is from base station B.
 * In the interrupt of the sync light, we represent the base station information with the value of
 * flag_A_station: according to flag_station == 1 (A),flag_station == 2 (B). Meanwhile, the falling
 * edge moment of sync is stored separately to t_d_start .
 *
 * Finally, the sweep appears, and we choose to update the data to A_X A_Y or B_X B_Y depending on
 * the value of flag_A_station. loca_duration is the difference between the previously stored t_d_start
 * and the falling edge moment of the sweep, t_0_start.
 *
 * This logic works fine in the presence of 1 or 2 lighthouses.
